# scrimpy.py

A simple Python module to be used as a base for single file batch scripts.
Instead of creating `.bat` files on Windows, scrimpy can be used.
Never use this codebase for something larger than single file batch scripts.


# Installation

No need to install.
This will be a base for a quick and dirty batch file replacement on Windows.
So, simply download and edit a copy of it.


# Requirements

The only requirement is Python.
This is almost always installed on a Linux distribution.

For Windows systems, [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) needs to be installed.
